# Taylor — Classical Mechanics
## Chapter 1: Newton’s Laws and Inertial Frames

### What I’m trying to be able to do after this chapter
- Clearly define an inertial frame and identify when a frame is non-inertial
- Use fictitious forces correctly when changing frames
- Model constrained motion cleanly

### Session log
- (Add dated bullets here as you study)

### Questions / loose ends
- (Things to revisit)
