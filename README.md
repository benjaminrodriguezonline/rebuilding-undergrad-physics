# Rebuilding the Undergraduate Physics Core

This repository documents my independent reconstruction of the core undergraduate physics curriculum, with an emphasis on:

- Classical Mechanics (Taylor)
- Electrodynamics (Griffiths)
- Quantum Mechanics (Griffiths)

The purpose of this project is twofold:
1. To rigorously rebuild my technical foundation in upper-division physics through systematic study and problem-solving.
2. To maintain a transparent, versioned technical record of this work as a learning archive and professional portfolio.

This repository is organized by subject and textbook, with chapter-level notes, derivations, and selected worked problems.

This is a living project. Early notes may be rough and are revised over time as understanding deepens.
