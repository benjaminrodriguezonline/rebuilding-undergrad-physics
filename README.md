# Rebuilding the Undergraduate Physics Core

This repository documents my independent reconstruction of the core undergraduate physics curriculum, focusing on:

- Classical Mechanics (Taylor)
- Electrodynamics (Griffiths)
- Quantum Mechanics (Griffiths)

This is a living archive of handwritten notes (exported PDFs), selected worked problems, and occasional typed summaries.
